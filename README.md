I compiled the [sample project of WhatsApp's stickers project](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers).

### Info

 - Compiled with a debug key
 - Changed package name from com.example.samplestickerapp to com.sample.samplestickerapp (project checks if the package starts with com.whatsapp or com.example).

 Modified file is available in the repo.
 - Nothing changed except for the package name as I said...
